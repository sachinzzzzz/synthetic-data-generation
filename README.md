In blender the 3D digital twin was created with the simulation decrease in the number of product with time. (for example when shelf picture would be clicked after a time period then the number of product would be less as some buyers will buy it.) This data were generated to train the ML models which will then give the insights about the sold  product and users choice to the decision makers.
Running these scripts will give required number of data points. here we generated 1600 data points.
script:</br>
1.make a json file including id, label, object_name as key</br>
2.run gen.py(generate all mask, bbox, countors at same time->takes more time)

# Human synthetic data
Made and simulate buyers behavior at a store to generate data to train the ML model to give insights about the buyers and the product which are engaging for them.
This data will then share with the decision makers to make decision
